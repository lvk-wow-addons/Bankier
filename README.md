# Bankier
World of Warcraft Addon: Bank manager

This addon will help me automatically keep a certain number of items of specific
types in my inventory.

It will notify me when I have too few (or too many) of a configured item, and if I then visit
the bank it will automatically withdraw or deposit items as needed.

The "certain number" can also be 0, in which it will just deposit the items to my bank when
I visit it.
